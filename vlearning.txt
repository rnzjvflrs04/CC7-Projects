EXISTING PROJECT:
Virtual & Augmented Reality in Pre-school Education (CLASS VR)
-The focus of the project is about learning through experience. Young students benefit from immersive 360 environments. VR and AR is used to enhance and complement the real-world exploration and play that builds a solid foundation in the pre-school years.
USABILITY KIT:
1.Pencil and Paper
-Ideas will be sketched in papers. It’s fast, cheap, and helps express ideas that may take hours in software. This is especially important because moving from sketches to hi-fidelity can cost much more in 3D than in 2D.
2.Software
-The software that will be used to design will be Unity or Unreal Engine. Cinema 4D and Maya are also widely used, but mostly for complex animations and renderings.
